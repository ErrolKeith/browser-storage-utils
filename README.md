# `browser-storage-utils`

`browser-storage-utils` is intended to be a fully typed Vanilla JS (Framework Agnostic) function that returns utilities for managing browser storage based on a configuration, while abstracting the [Web Browser API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API) and [Document Cookies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/cookie) away from the package consumer (slightly opinionated for the purposes of passing data with type coverage).

> :warning: THIS PACKAGE IS IN BETA. DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION and Use at your own risk. Future changes will <u>_NOT_</u> respect any currently present API.

> :warning: This package does not intend to and will not work with browsers who don't suport cookies.
